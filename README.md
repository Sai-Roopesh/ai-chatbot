# React + Vite Template

## Overview

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some ESLint rules. It includes two official plugins:

- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc**: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh**: Utilizes either Babel or SWC for Fast Refresh, depending on the chosen plugin.
- **ESLint**: Includes ESLint with some predefined rules to maintain code quality.
